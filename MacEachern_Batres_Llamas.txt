Milestone #1: Spoon Game
Victoria Batres, Itzel Llamas, and Olivia MacEachern

Functionality:
Problem: We are trying to create a program for the Spoon Game to keep track of current active players and those who are eliminated. Within this system, students will be able to self report themselves as eliminated or successful and the automatically be given their next target

Description of target user: The target user would be anyone participating in the spoon game including forum, students, and faculty. 

Description of programs functionality: 
Core features: 
Keeps track of who is eliminated and who is still in the game
Students are able to self-report who they have eliminated
Inputs/outputs:
Inputs a csv file that contains information on every participant. The participants' names, grade (if applicable), and a value for if they are still in the game (0/1). 
Outputs a notification of their target, along with how many people they’ve eliminated, and what round it is. 
2-3 extra features: 
Create a randomized passkey for each student so only they can report whether or not they are eliminated
Create rounds in terms of number of people eliminated. For example, when 20 people are eliminated, round 1 is over. However, the survive the round, you need to have eliminated someone. 
Task Planning:
	Next steps?: 
Creating a file with sample data, coding classes, testing code as a fake student, adding in additional components 
	
	Divided tasks:
Itzel: tester class
Victoria and Olivia: spoon class
Feedback: 
On the general structure of our code and if our approach makes sense
