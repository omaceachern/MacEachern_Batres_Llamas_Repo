## Description
We are trying to create a program for the Spoon Game to keep track of current active players and those who are eliminated. Within this system, students will be able to self report themselves as eliminated or successful and the automatically be given their next target  
The target user would be anyone participating in the spoon game including forum, students, and faculty  
Core features:   
    * Keeps track of who is eliminated and who is still in the game  
    * Students are able to self-report who they have eliminated  
Inputs/outputs:  
    * Inputs a csv file that contains information on every participant. The participants' names, grade (if applicable), and a value for if they are still in the game (0/1).   
    * Outputs a notification of their target, along with how many people they’ve eliminated, and what round it is.   
2-3 extra features:   
    * Create a randomized passkey for each student so only they can report whether or not they are eliminated  
    * Create rounds in terms of number of people eliminated. For example, when 20 people are eliminated, round 1 is over.
